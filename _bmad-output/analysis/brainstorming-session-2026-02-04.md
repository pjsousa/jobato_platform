# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** {{user_name}}
**Date:** {{date}}

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Daily Google-query-driven job discovery crawler/parser with allowlisted sites, deduplication, and relevance filtering
**Goals:** Surface new relevant job posts daily, suppress duplicates/irrelevant posts, and present results in a simple web UI

### Context Guidance

_No additional context file provided._

### Session Setup

We will explore divergent idea spaces across product, technical, data, and UX angles to generate a broad set of options before converging.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Daily Google-query-driven job discovery crawler/parser with allowlisted sites, deduplication, and relevance filtering with focus on surfacing new relevant jobs daily, suppressing duplicates/irrelevant posts, and presenting results in a simple web UI

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Question Storming:** Expand unknowns and decision points before solutioning.
- **Morphological Analysis:** Systematically explore combinations across data, scheduling, dedupe, relevance, storage, and UI.
- **Reverse Brainstorming:** Expose failure modes to drive safeguards and quality controls.

**AI Rationale:** The problem is complex with many interdependent choices; we start by opening the question space, then map structured options, and finish by stress-testing the pipeline through failure-first thinking.
